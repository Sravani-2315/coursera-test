<h1> Chicken</h1>
<p> Chickens are large, round, short-winged birds that were domesticated from the red junglefowl of Southeast Asia around 8,000 years ago. They are raised worldwide for their meat and eggs. Some chickens are also kept as pets or for cockfighting. Chickens are very intelligent animals. Studies have shown that they are self-aware and can distinguish themselves from others. They can also demonstrate complex problem-solving skills. <p>
<h1> Beef</h1>
<p> Beef is the culinary term for meat from cattle. It's the third most consumed meat in the world, accounting for about 25% of meat production. Beef is high in protein, iron, and vitamin B12. It's also rich in vitamins and minerals, which may help with muscle growth and exercise performance. Beef is prepared in various ways. Cuts are often used for steak, while trimmings are often ground or minced. In the United States, steaks are among the most desirable cuts.<p>
<h1> Sushi</h1>
<p> Sushi is a Japanese dish that's made with vinegared rice and a variety of ingredients. The rice is usually medium-grained and cooked in vinegar. The ingredients can include vegetables, meat, or seafood, which can be raw or cooked. Sushi is served cold and is often garnished with egg or vegetables. Sushi is different from sashimi, which is raw fish without vinegared rice. Sushi can also include cooked ingredients, like shrimp tempura or eggs. <p>
