<p> Chickens are large, round, short-winged birds that were domesticated from the red junglefowl of Southeast Asia around 8,000 years ago. They are raised worldwide for their meat and eggs. Some chickens are also kept as pets or for cockfighting. Chickens are very intelligent animals. Studies have shown that they are self-aware and can distinguish themselves from others. They can also demonstrate complex problem-solving skills. </p>
